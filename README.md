"SauceDemo" is a fictional online store that is often used as a test platform for software testing and training purposes. It is created by the company "Sauce Labs," which provides a cloud-based testing platform for web and mobile applications. The SauceDemo website includes various product categories, such as backpacks, t-shirts, and hoodies, and allows users to create accounts, add products to a shopping cart, and complete orders.
The purpose of SauceDemo is to provide a realistic and interactive environment for software testing, particularly for testing the functionality of e-commerce websites and applications. Developers and testers can use SauceDemo to practice and refine their testing skills, as well as to identify and fix bugs and issues in their software. Additionally, SauceDemo is often used for training purposes, as it provides a safe and controlled environment for users to learn how to use different testing tools and techniques.
